## React Tutorial implemented with TypeScript

Here you can find how I passed through [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) [Tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/). It was very fun.

If you want to start to use `TypeScript + Reactjs + Webpack` and start from React tutorial then you can find here answers for some questions like *why `this.state` is undefined* or *why `this.ref` doesn't has property "author"* or *How use `setInterval` in TypeScript?* (that about `lambda` and `this` in TypeScript) and other.

But I want advise to peep into the repository only when you have used [google](http://google.com), [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [TypeScript Handbook](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook) and saw generated `JS` code and if after all of that you can't understand why nothing is worked.
