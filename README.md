## React Tutorial implemented with TypeScript

Here's how I passed through [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) [Tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/). It was very fun.

If you want to start, use `TypeScript + Reactjs + Webpack`.
If you start from React tutorial, you will find some answers for some questions like
* why `this.state` is `undefined`?
* why `this.ref` doesn't have property "author"? 
* how to use `setInterval` in TypeScript? (this is about `lambda` and `this` in TypeScript)
* and others.

I will advise readers to use this repository only after they have tried 
[Google](http://google.com), [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), 
[TypeScript Handbook](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook) and generated native `javascript` code without any results.
